# C++ On The Web

The WebAssembly (Wasm) format is a way to run code, compiled from native languages such as C/C++, on modern web browsers. WebAssembly is often used in performance-critical web applications such as games, image processing, and artificial intelligence. Generally, functions can be implemented in Wasm and can be imported like a library into JavaScript, bringing with it native-like performance over traditional JavaScript. In this lecture, we will dive under the hood of web assembly and at the same time understand more how C++ itself works.
